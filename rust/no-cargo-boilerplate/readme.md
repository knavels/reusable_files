# How to use rust-analyzer in vscode without cargo
run `update_sysroot.ps1` on windows or `update_sysroot.sh` on linux (make it executable first `chmod +x update_sysroot.sh`) and you're done.

# `Makefile` commands
simply use `make clean` to clean up output files, `make build` to clean and build, `make run` to clean, build and run.
